I dusted off an old but intact copy of the Ukiah High School website that I found on the Internet Archive. A fellow student and I built this website back in 1997 when we were seniors.

Check out the source code for an awesome trip to the past. A "Netscape Comm. Corp." DTD, check. Uppercase HTML tags, check. No CSS, check. Old school textured background, check. Visit counter, check!
