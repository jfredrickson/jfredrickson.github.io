Those of you who have used [TDDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_device_for_the_deaf) in the 80s and 90s will appreciate this.

One day, I noticed that the domain registrar Freenom was offering free `.ga` (Gabon) domain registration. So of course I had to do something TDD/TTY related, and registered `helloq.ga` for this project. Now the `.ga` TLD is no longer available for registration, but you can still view an archive of the site!

Hint: After loading [the website](https://jfredrickson.github.io/helloqga/), start typing.
