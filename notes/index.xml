TrueNAS already has built-in support for ACME DNS authentication, but the only DNS authenticator it supports is Route 53.
This process will create a certbot jail that:
Configures certbot to get a Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt wildcard certificate Runs certbot renew every 12 hours Saves certificates to a dataset so that they can be used by other services Deploys renewed certificates to the TrueNAS UI You can skip the stuff about creating a dataset and mounting it to the jail if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to use the certificates for anything other than the TrueNAS UI.</description></item><item><title>Macintosh file type and creator data</title><link>https://ejeff.org/notes/macintosh-file-type-and-creator-data/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ejeff.org/notes/macintosh-file-type-and-creator-data/</guid><description>Sometimes when transferring a file from a modern computer to a classic Macintosh (e.g., System 7), its resource fork disappears into the great aether for certain reasons. As a result, the Mac doesn&amp;rsquo;t know what type of file it is and can&amp;rsquo;t open it. Specifically, the OS needs to know the Type and Creator metadata that was stored in the resource fork.
To correct a missing resource fork, use ResEdit. But what are the correct Type and Creator entries?</description></item><item><title>Roomba zones in Home Assistant</title><link>https://ejeff.org/notes/roomba-zones-in-home-assistant/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ejeff.org/notes/roomba-zones-in-home-assistant/</guid><description>There doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear to be a straightforward way to have Home Assistant work with custom Roomba zones. It takes some legwork.
I&amp;rsquo;ve designated a Roomba zone around our Litter-Robot with the intention of having the vacuum clean up any stray litter after one of the cats uses the litter box.
But in order to get a Home Assistant script to send the Roomba to that zone, I need to know the Roomba&amp;rsquo;s pmap_id and region_id fields from the iRobot API.</description></item></channel></rss>
