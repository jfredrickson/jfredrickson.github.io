Those of you who have used [TDDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_device_for_the_deaf) in the 80s and 90s will appreciate this.

One day, I noticed that the domain registrar Freenom was offering free `.ga` (Gabon) domain registration. So of course I had to do something TDD related.

Hint: After loading [the website](https://helloq.ga/), start typing.
